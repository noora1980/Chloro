0.04	11/13/2014	Vancouver, BC

- Simplify usage of 'cpbase_search' command by limiting
  the functionality to only getting genome sequences and statistics.
  (The other features were too complicated to maintain and test in this
  application and will be put into an API for CpBase.)
- Add method to write search results for 'cpbase_search' command
  to a file instead of stdout (and add tests for this).
- Add automated method to build dependencies, which removes a step
  during the install process.
- Remove use of libxml (XML::LibXML) due to the requirement of external
  C libraries that would have to be installed by an admin.
- Modify 'screen_reads' command execution to reuse the same method instead
  of duplicating code for executing commands.
- Add portable paths for test commands and files.
