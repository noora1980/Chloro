=head1 NAME

Chloro - Automated chloroplast genome assembly

=head1 SYNOPSIS    

=head1 DESCRIPTION
     
This application will assist the process of creating a screening database of chloroplast genomes, then it will allow the screening of NGS reads against this database. Paired-end reads will be correctly paired and the screened reads will be assembled.

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

The modules App::Cmd, LWP::UserAgent, IPC::System::Simple, and Capture::Tiny are required. See below for information
